## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jaewon Kim!

### ðŸŽ“ Senior at San Jose State University, studying Computer Science
### ðŸ’¼ AI/ML Fellow at Arity through Break Through Tech AI Program
### ðŸ”­ Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with Sustainability, passsionate, and Enthusiast

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. 
Iâ€™m passionate on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is a big key to growth. 
(Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a Break Through Tech Fellow experiences!) 

Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. 
Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals.

 
## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Driving Behavior Analysis For Arity (Mobility Data Company)
What We are doing: My team will use vehicle telematics and sensor data to classify different types of driving maneuvers, such as turns, lane changes, and U-turns. Understanding these patterns can improve driver safety programs, power usage-based insurance pricing, and enhance autonomous vehicle systems. This could be approached as a classification problem, though other modeling strategies may also be relevant.
Tools: Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, and etc (coming soon!)
